 * sender referenced that he/she previously received one bitcoin, then a
 * transaction output was created showing that 1 Bitcoin was sent to your
 * address. (Transaction inputs are references to previous transaction outputs).
 * 
 * This class will be used to reference TransactionOutputs that have not yet
 * been spent. The transactionOutputId will be used to find the relevant
 * TransactionOutput, allowing miners to check your ownership.
